          <p><b>Hello!</b> I'm Sally (or Yubin) and currently, I am a senior majoring in Computer Science degree with a minor in Creative Technology & Design at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
             I'm very interested in working as a Software Engineer after graduation and for long term goal, I am seeking to become a full-stack engineer.
             I was born in Daegu, South Korea, and came to the United States alone when I was 12 years old. One of my greatest strength is adaptability.
             To survive, I had to learn and challenge myself to adapt to any environment quickly, and also, I had to make my own network from scratch.
             I believe my adaptability can let me uniquely contribute to any environment for my career.

            </p>

          <p>Currently, I'm a Research Lab Assistant at CUPLV (Programming Languages And Verification at University of Colorado - Boulder) since Feb 2021.
            I’ve been a passionate student who’s seeking a challenging but rewarding experience that pushes me out of my comfort zone.
            To pursue a wider range of knowledge that I can’t learn from a university, I founded a club called HAWC aka. ‘Hacking for Asian Women Crew’ in sophomore.
            <br><br>
              I am looking forward to learn more various tools and technologies in programming and excited to begin a new journey after May 2022!
