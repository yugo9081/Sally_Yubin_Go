          <div id="col1">
          <p> My name is Sally and currently, I am a senior majoring in CS at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
             I chose this major because being a programmer seems very cool and it can lead to a great career option.
             I’ve been a passionate student who’s seeking a challenging but rewarding experience that pushes me out of my comfort zone.
             To pursue a wider range of knowledge that I can’t learn from a university, I founded a club called HAWC aka. Hacking for Asian Women Crew in sophomore year.
             Not just awarded as the best project from cs course,  I have three work experiences in three different fields such as robotics, web development, and hardware.
              With these experiences in various fields, I believe It will definitely help me to communicate with various teams and can apply this knowledge to work.
            </p>
